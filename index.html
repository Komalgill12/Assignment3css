            <p>Caramel was first made by American settlers in the 17th century, and today, it's one of the most popular dessert toppings worldwide!</p>
            <p>The word ‘sundae’ might have originated from ‘Sunday,’ as these treats were often served on that day to avoid the soda fountain’s popularity during Prohibition."
                "Caramel is made by heating sugar until it turns into a golden liquid, a process that dates back over a thousand years."</p>
